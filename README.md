# AngularTourOfHeroes

## Continued Learning

Although I have worked with Angular & AngularJS in the past a measure of time has passed. I wanted to spend a little time refreshing myself and looking at changes to architecture, tooling, recommended approach, etc... 

Doing this alwasy offers a chance to refresh myself as well as gauging how well both my memory and the languages stability (novely viewed) stand up over time. 

_Feel free to take this code and do with it what you will for your own amusement an viewing pleasure_

TODO: Fix the generated test and create some new ones for appropriate test coverage. Just because it's a tutorial is no excuse to not consider testing.
